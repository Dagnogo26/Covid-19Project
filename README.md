# Covid-Project

The goal of this project is to analyze the COVID-19 spread from March 2020 to March 2021.
For this exercise, we will be retrieving the data using an API data (The COVID Tracking Project).
We will be retrieving the data for the 50 states adne examining how they were affected by the virus, the top 3 states more impacted in term of death and positive testings.
Our findings will be converted into graphs using plotly to give the reader a visualization approach of the phenomenom examined as well as
heatmap to see how the states suffered in term of deaths.
At the end of he anaysis, we noticed that NY, CA and NJ have the highest deaths although CA, TX and FL have the highest total positive test results.
We also noticed a positive correlation between positive test results and deaths for NY, CA and NJ.
